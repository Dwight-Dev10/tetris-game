# 🎮 Java Tetris(Swing)

A fully playable Tetris clone built in Java using Swing, designed with object-oriented principles, a custom game loop, and clean separation between rendering, game logic, input, and audio systems.

This project was built to strengthen Java fundamentals, explore OOP design, and practice system-level thinking through a complete, shippable application.

✨ Features:
  🧱 Classic Tetris gameplay
  🔄 Piece rotation with collision handling
  ⬇️ Gravity-based drop system with frame timing
  ⌨️ Keyboard input handling
  ⏸️ Pause functionality
  🔊 Sound effects and background music
  🧠 Next-piece preview
  🧩 Line clearing & stacking logic
  🖼️ Custom rendering using Graphics2D

# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project is structured to keep responsibilities clear and maintainable:

**Core Components**

- GamePanel
  - Main rendering surface.
  - Owns the game loop (FPS + delta timing).
  - Delegates updates and drawing.

- PlayManager
  - Central game controller.
  - Manages game state, piece lifecycle, and rules.
  - Coordinates current piece, next piece, and static blocks.

- Arks_main
  - Base class for all Tetris pieces.
  - Handles movement, rotation, collision detection.
  - Uses inheritance for shape-specific behavior.

- Block
  - Represents a single tile unit.
  - Encapsulates position, size, and color.

- KeyHandler
  - Captures and processes player input.
  - Decoupled from game logic.

- Sound
  - Handles audio playback and looping.
  - Loads resources from the classpath.
  - Manages sound effects and music independently.

# 🧠 OOP & Design Principles Used
- Encapsulation
  -  Each class owns a single responsibility.
- Inheritance
  - Tetris pieces extend a shared base (Arks_main)

- Polymorphism
  - Different shapes respond uniformly to update/draw calls

- Separation of Concerns
  - Rendering, input, logic, and audio are isolated

- Game Loop Pattern
  - Fixed FPS with delta-based updates

# 🛠️ Technologies

- Java 21
- Java Swing
- Java Sound API
- Graphics2D
- IntelliJ IDEA
